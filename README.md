# This script adds a dropdown button to the header that allows the option to highlight the Power Chatter and Chatters on the page.

# The Chat Preference dropdown shows three options –

# Power Chatter – Select the power chatter option to highlight all the power chatters on the page. I like to check if we have given chats to all the power chatters before moving to HEs with chat preference. The full row is highlighted except the availability blocks.
# Chatters – Select the chatters option to highlight all the HEs who prefer chat. Once we have assigned the chat to all the folks with chat preference, we can distribute the remaining chats to the HEs with ticket preference.
# Reset – This button resets the changes and removes all the page’s highlights.
